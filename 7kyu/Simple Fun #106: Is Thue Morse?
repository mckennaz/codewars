// The infinite Thue-Morse sequence is obtained by first taking a sequence containing a single 0 and then repeatedly concatenating the current sequence with its binary complement.

// A binary complement of a sequence X is a sequence Y of the same length such that the sum of elements X_i and Y_i on the same positions is equal to 1 for each i.

// Thus the first few iterations to obtain Thue-Morse sequence are:

// 0
// 0 1
// 0 1 1 0
// 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1
// ...
